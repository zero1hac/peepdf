# Installation #
<br />
It's not necessary to install anything to execute the tool, just executing the Python interpreter with peepdf.py. However, to use all its functionalities it's recommended the installation of some external packages.

The packages and libraries needed to have a full installation of peepdf are the following:

  * _lxml_ (external in Windows): creation of XML otuput. Only needed with -x.
  * _PyV8_ (external): execution of Javascript code.
  * _pylibemu_ (external): Libemu Python wrapper to emulate the shellcode execution.
